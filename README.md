# AI Resume Reader Chatbot

Thank you for taking the time to review my submission. I am grateful for the opportunity to present this project, which demonstrates my ability to integrate OCR, OpenAI APIs, and a responsive web frontend to build a practical AI-driven application.

## üìå Objective

The AI Resume Reader Chatbot is a web-based application that allows users to upload resumes (PDF or image) and automatically extract key information. The extracted data is displayed in a clean and organized table format within a chatbot interface.

The system performs the following:

1. Extract resume content using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).  
2. Process the extracted text using OpenAI GPT-4 / GPT-3.5 Turbo to identify key information.  
3. Display the extracted factors in a user-friendly table inside the chatbot interface.
